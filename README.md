Arcade Game
===============================

# Project Description

The Arcade Game Project from Udacity Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program is an implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger. Goal of the project is to practice JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features by writing classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. Using provided visual assets and a game loop engine, students are reqiered to add a number of entities and methods to the game including the player characters and enemies. Starter code and files can be cloned or downloaded from this repository https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.

## Game Description

There are a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the score is reset to zero and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won, and the user is alerted with current score.
